NOTE:
  
- Used Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 to make/test the web app. May Have complatiblity issues.
  
- limited assets for APPS webpage only found the 3 pictures in the assests given my zeplin.
  
- some icons/buttons takes you to google.com
  
- Bootstrap framwork used but dont completly understand it 

Things still need to be done
  
- using BEM methods more.
  
- SASS. I understand this to be a althernative to CSS, SASS has more built in tools and converts to css for the html pages.
  
- Javascript packager.
  
- Reactjs, Redux, React-Route for saving login states
 
- Enzyme Tests
